## Introduction

The "Elite Tech Dev Club" (ETDC) is a student organization dedicated to promoting the use of advanced and challenging technologies in software development. 



## Project Commitment

ETDC is committed to developing a desktop application for Texas Tech University, designed to surpass the official university website in efficiency and functionality.

- ### Technologies Used

Combining Rust for backend performance and Electron for frontend design, we leverage the best of both worlds in desktop application development.
